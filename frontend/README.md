# Time Keeping - Frontend

## Requirements

- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [the correct node version](.nvmrc).

## Get Started

All the commands assume that you are in the `frontend` folder (from root).

Select/install the correct node version

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
npm install
npm start
```

If you have [the correct node version](.nvmrc) installed (`node --version` shows the same version), you can jump directly to `npm install` step.

## Technologies

This project uses

- React: Just like mentioned above.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): After the sunset of Create React App, Vite is one of the best ways to create SPA with React.
